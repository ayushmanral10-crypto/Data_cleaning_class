Project Summary: Students Performance Analysis
This project focuses on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning modeling using the Students Performance dataset.
The objective is to understand how different factors affect student performance and to build a Linear Regression model to predict academic sco

This updated .ipynb(Students Performance Analysis) contains following steps:
a. Importing Required Libraries:
   NumPy, Pandas → data handling
   Matplotlib, Seaborn → visualization
   Scikit-learn → model building & evaluation

b. Loading the Dataset
   Loaded the students performance dataset using Pandas.

c. Data Cleaning
   Checked for missing values and handled them.
   Converted categorical variables into numerical form using encoding.

d. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   Visualized score distributions using histograms.
   Checked outlier by plotting boxplots.

e. Feature Selection
  Selected relevant independent variables.
  Defined the target variable (student score).

f. Train-Test Split
  Splitted the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

g. Model Building (Linear Regression)
  Implemented Linear Regression using Scikit-learn.
  Trained the model on the training dataset.

h. Model Prediction
  Generated predictions on the test data
  Compared predicted values with actual values.

i. Model Evaluation
  Calculated evaluation metrics such as:
  Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  R² Score
